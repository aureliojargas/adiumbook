# AdiumBook

![](https://aurelio.net/projects/adiumbook/shot-interface-v13.png)

AdiumBook was a free Mac OS X bridge application between Adium and Apple's Address Book, used to search, manage and keep your contacts in sync.

- Website: https://aurelio.net/projects/adiumbook/
- License: 2-clause BSD
- First release: version 1.0 (Aug 2005, for Mac OS X Tiger)
- Last release: version 1.5.1 (Nov 2009, for Mac OS X Snow Leopard)

I've worked in this app from 2005 to 2009. Then I've stopped using Adium and never touched this code again.

## AppleScript app

The app is written in AppleScript, using the now deprecated AppleScript Studio framework that was supported in Xcode from Mac OS X 10.2 to 10.5 (Jaguar to Leopard).

- Main script: [xcode/Adium Book.applescript](https://github.com/aureliojargas/adiumbook/blob/master/xcode/Adium%20Book.applescript)

## Migration to GitHub and archival

In June 2020 I've migrated this repository from the old Google Code SVN to GitHub (details in [svn2git/](https://github.com/aureliojargas/adiumbook/tree/master/svn2git)) and did some small administrative tasks to be able to properly archive this project:

- Added this README file
- Added a LICENSE file
- Added all the [release tags](https://github.com/aureliojargas/adiumbook/tags)
- Converted the old wiki Changelog to Markdown
- Archived the old releases into [releases/](https://github.com/aureliojargas/adiumbook/tree/master/releases)
