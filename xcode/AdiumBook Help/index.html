<H1>About AdiumBook</H1>
<P>
AdiumBook is an application useful to keep updated the information of your Adium and Address Book contacts.
</P>
<P>
You have some friends on your Address Book, right? But all of them are already added to your Adium contact list? AdiumBook can help you to find out.
</P>
<P>
You have lots of friends on your Adium contact list, some with nice pictures. Wouldn't it be nice to add them to your Address Book with a single button click? AdiumBook can make it for you.
</P>
<P>
Which of your Address Book cards don't have any IM field filled? And which don't have a picture? And which do use Jabber? AdiumBook comes to the rescue once again!
</P>
<A NAME="intro"></A>
<H1>First steps</H1>
<P>
If you're new to AdiumBook, follow these steps:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Run AdiumBook — Easy, uh?
<P></P>
<LI>Choose the <B>Reports &gt; Adium contacts not in AB</B> menu item (or just press Command-8)
<P></P>
AdiumBook will scan all your contacts and will try to find all your Adium contacts that still don't have a card on your Address Book.
<P></P>
<LI>Choose some contact on the Adium list (left side).
<P></P>
Her/his name and IM login will appear on the details pane below. A picture will also appear if she/he defined one.
<P></P>
Maybe you have this person on your Address Book, maybe don't. The report searches only by the IM field in Address Book, ignoring names, nicknames and e-mail addresses. But there is a button that makes a more detailed search.
<P></P>
<LI>Press the Find button. <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../but-find-ab.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> 
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-set-im.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> If you already have this person on your Address Book, she/he will appear on the listings at the right side. Just click on the name and the details will appear below. Now check the IM fields on the Address Book side. If they don't match with the current Adium contact, you can use the <B>Set IM</B> button to fix it. It's important to set the IM field of all your contacts, so Adium can recognize this person.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-set-pict.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> If the Address Book contact (right) doesn't have a picture, but the Adium contact (left) have, you can copy this picture pressing the <B>Set Pic</B> button. It will appear instantly on the right side.
<P></P>
<IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-add-card.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> If you don't have this person on your Address Book, you can add she/he by pressing the <B>Add</B> button. Simple as that. The name, IM login and picture will be filled in the card. Now you can press the <B>Card</B> button <IMG ALIGN="middle" SRC="../but-reveal-ab.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> to edit this new card in Address Book.
<P></P>
<LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every contact and you'll end with a very complete and consistent Address Book data.
</OL>

<P>
Run AdiumBook from time to time to keep your contacts updated!

  <P></P>
  </UL>
<LI><B>Note:</B> Besides the new full text search on the Find buttons,

<H1>Tips &amp; Tricks</H1>
<UL>
<LI>If you want to <B>list all your contacts</B>,
  just make an empty search:
  delete the search text or press the X button.
<P></P>
<LI>The <B>text search is case insensitive</B>,
  so don't mind about capitalization.
  <IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="img/click-drag.png" class="bordered" BORDER="0" ALT="">
<P></P>
<LI>The search results are sorted by name.
  You can <B>click on the table headings</B> to change the sort column.
  A second click makes a reverse sort.
<P></P>
<LI>You can <B>drag the table headings</B> inner border
  to resize the columns width. See picture.
<P></P>
<LI>In Address Book view, to copy the selected IM login to the clipboard,
  <B>right click it</B>.
  Yes, right click the Pop-up button.
<P></P>
<LI><B>Adium must be Online</B>.
  If don't, the search results will be very poor and incomplete.
<P></P>
<LI>When you launch this application,
  <B>both Adium and Address Book are also launched</B>
  (if they aren't already running).
  AdiumBook needs them.
<P></P>
<LI>To <B>fully integrate the applications</B>, set up Adium to get the
  contact's information from Address Book (picture and name).
  Open Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Address Book and check the following:
<P></P>
  <UL>
  <LI>Import my contacts' names from the Address Book
  <LI>Use Address Book images as contacts' icons
  <LI>Combine contacts listed on a single card
    (or <I>Consolidate contacts listed in the card</I> for older versions)
  </UL>

<H1>Buttons</H1>
<DL>
<DT><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-find-ab.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> Try to find in Address Book the selected Adium contact.</DT><DD>
<P></P>
The information for the currently selected contact (IM login and full name)
is searched on the Address Book cards. AdiumBook tries to find them on the
following fields: full name, nickname, e-mail addresses and IM information
(AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo and Jabber). The found contacts will appear
on the Address Book side (right).
<P></P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-find-adium.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> Try to find in Adium the selected Address Book contact.</DT><DD>

it gathers all the information for the current Address Book contact
(full name, nickname, e-mail addresses, AIM/ICQ/MSN/Yahoo/Jabber names)
and tries to find it on the Adium contact list (full name and IM login).
The found contacts will appear on the Adium side (left).
<P></P>
<B>Note:</B> Multiple entries for the same person can appear,
but each for a different IM service,
and possibly with a different picture.
<P></P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-reveal-ab.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> Show the contact's card in Address Book.</DT><DD>

its search field must be empty.
<P></P>
<DT><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../but-add-card.png" BORDER="0" ALT=""> Add the Adium contact to Address Book.</DT><DD>

with no IM" report (see <A HREF="#reports">Reports</A>).
<P></P>
<B>Note:</B> This button really sets the Address Book card IM field. It
doesn't overwrite the previous contents (if any), but creates a new
field.
